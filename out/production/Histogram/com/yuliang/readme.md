 + Serial version(max of intensity is 10)
 + Parallel version using AtomicInteger(max of intensity is 10)
 + Parallel version using AtomicInteger(max of intensity is 100)
 + Parallel version using normal int counter(max of intensity is 100)
 + Parallel version using normal int counter and private result(max of intensity is 100)
